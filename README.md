# DB_Projects
The goal of this project is to create a Database Management System that uses 3-tier architecture
Website is running on http://eve.kean.edu/~blondebr/CPS5740/
Phase one: barebones project with limited functionality
View all employees
This section is meant to show the user everyone's login information on the MySQL database so that they can access the rest of the website
  
Employee Login
Using login information from "View all employees" users can access employee pages.
Pages vary based on the employee's role. Either manager or employee.
    
"View all customers" will pull the login information of all the customers. This can be used to login to Customer Login page
